Password Generator will ask you a series of questions to determine the length and parameters needed for your password. This is done through using window prompts. Clicking "OK" means "YES" and "CANCEL" means "NO". The password generator will confirm each statement to you. If you make a mistake you have to start over.

Once finished with the prompts, the code utilizes javascript functions and for loops to reveal a secure password just for you.
